= Contact = 

== Bug Reports ==

We use the built-in issue tracker like a to-do list, so you may submit any bugs, but also feature requests [http://code.google.com/p/mingus/issues/list there].

== Mailing Lists ==

Mingus uses Google Groups for most of its communication. The main list, [http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python `mingus-python`], is reserved 
for questions, suggestions, one-of patches, recommendations and requests, and is also used to announce 
new releases with some usage examples.

For automated commit messages, issue tracker updates and general development talk, visit the [http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-devel `mingus-devel`] group.

Subscribing to this group will keep you informed of all the changes to the code-base and is recommended 
for contributors and packagers.

== IRC ==

For development talk you can also visit the #mingus channel on freenode.net.
