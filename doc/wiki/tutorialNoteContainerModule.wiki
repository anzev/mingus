#summary The mingus.containers.NoteContainers module

----

= Tutorial 2 - !NoteContainers =

What if we want to store several Note objects at once (ie. intervals, chords)? We could use a simple list and be done with it, but we could 
also use a !NoteContainer, which has some extra functionality and is used throughout this package. 

== Import the !NoteContainer Class ==

{{{

>>> from mingus.containers.NoteContainer import NoteContainer

}}}

----

== Creating a New !NoteContainer ==

A new !NoteContainer is easily created. You can create empty ones or ones already filled with notes:

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer()
>>> n
[]
>>> n = NoteContainer(Note("A", 4))
>>> n
['A-4']
>>> n = NoteContainer("A")
>>> n
['A-4']
>>> n = NoteContainer(["A-3", "C-5", "E-5"])
>>> n
['A-3', 'C-5', 'E-5']

}}}

----

== Adding Notes to a !NoteContainer ==

Add a single note as a string ("C", "C-5", etc.) or a Note object.

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer()
>>> n.add_note("C")
>>> n
['C-4']

}}}

Add multiple notes as a list of Note object or strings; or as another !NoteContainer. Single notes still work as well. The following examples all produce the same !NoteContainer:

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer()
>>> n.add_notes(["C", "E"])

}}}

{{{

>>> n.empty()
>>> n.add_notes(NoteContainer(["C", "E"])

}}}

{{{

>>> n.empty()
>>> n.add_notes([Note("C"), Note("E")])

}}}

{{{

>>> n.empty()
>>> n.add_notes(Note("C"))
>>> n.add_notes(Note("E"))

}}}

----

== Removing Notes from a !NoteContainer ==

Remove a single note:

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer(["C", "E", "G"])
>>> n.remove_note("E")
['C-4', 'G-4']
>>> n = NoteContainer(["C-4", "C-5"])
>>> n.remove_note("C")
[]

}}}

Removing a single note in a single octave:

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer(["C-4", "C-5"])
>>> n.remove_note("C", 4)
['C-5']

}}}

== Removing Multiple Notes from a !NoteContainer == 

Removing more than one note from a !NoteContainer:

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer(["C", "E", "G"])
>>> n.remove_notes(["C", "E"])
['G-4']

}}}

The function `remove_notes` accepts lists of strings and Note objects, but does also accepts all the things `remove_note` accepts.

----

== Using !NoteContainers as Lists ==

Some basic operators and functions are overloaded which will allow you to work on !NoteContainers as if they were lists.

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer(["C", "E", "G"])
>>> n[0]
'C-4'
>>> n[:-1]
['C-4', 'E-4']
>>> n[0] = "D"
>>> n
['D-4', 'E-4', 'G-4']
>>> len(n)
3

}}}


== The Overloaded '+' Operator ==

The '+' operator is overloaded for !NoteContainer objects. This means that you can use '+' instead of the verbose add_notes() function. 

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer()
>>> n + "C"
['C-4']
>>> n + ["E", "G"]
["C-4", "E-4", "G-4"]

}}}


== The Overloaded '-' Operator ==

The '-' operator is overloaded as well and redirects calls to `remove_notes`. It can be used like this:

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer(["C", "E", "G"])
>>> n - "E"
['C-4', 'G-4']
>>> n - ["C", "G"]
[]

}}}
----

== Other methods ==

The methods available in Note -transpose, augment, diminish, to_major and to_minor- are also available for !NoteContainers. When one of these functions get called the !NoteContainer calls the functions on every one of his Note objects.

An extra function is available to `determine` the type of chord or interval in the container.

{{{

>>> n = NoteContainer(["C", "E", "G"])
>>> n.determine()
['C major triad']
>>> n.determine(True)
['Cmaj']

}}}
