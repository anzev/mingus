= mingus.extra.fft =
Find the frequencies in raw audio data by using fast Fourier transformations
(supplied by numpy).

This module can also convert the found frequencies to Note objects.

Compute the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.

This function computes the one-dimensional *n*-point discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) with the efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm [CT].

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Input array, can be complex.
n : int, optional
    Length of the transformed axis of the output.
    If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
    If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
    the length of the input (along the axis specified by `axis`) is used.
axis : int, optional
    Axis over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last axis is
    used.

Returns
-------
out : complex ndarray
    The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
    indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.

Raises
------
IndexError
    if `axes` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

ifft : The inverse of `fft`.
fft2 : The two-dimensional FFT.
fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.

fftfreq : Frequency bins for given FFT parameters.

Notes
-----
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.

The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

In this example, real input has an FFT which is Hermitian, i.e., symmetric
in the real part and anti-symmetric in the imaginary part, as described in
the `numpy.fft` documentation.

=== `_find_log_index(f)` ===
Look up the index of the frequency f in the frequency table.

Return the nearest index.

=== `analyze_chunks(data, freq, bits, chunksize)` ===
  * *Default values*: chunksize = 512
Cut the one channel data in chunks and analyzes them separately.

Making the chunksize a power of two works fastest.

=== `data_from_file(file)` ===
Return (first channel data, sample frequency, sample width) from a .wav
file.

=== `find_Note(data, freq, bits)` ===
Get the frequencies, feed them to find_notes and the return the Note
with the highest amplitude.

=== `find_frequencies(data, freq, bits)` ===
  * *Default values*: freq = 44100, bits = 16
Convert audio data into a frequency-amplitude table using fast fourier
transformation.

Return a list of tuples (frequency, amplitude).

Data should only contain one channel of audio.

=== `find_melody(file, chunksize)` ===
  * *Default values*: file = '440_480_clean.wav', chunksize = 512
Cut the sample into chunks and analyze each chunk.

Return a list [(Note, chunks)] where chunks is the number of chunks
where that note is the most dominant.

If two consequent chunks turn out to return the same Note they are
grouped together.

This is an experimental function.

=== `find_notes(freqTable, maxNote)` ===
  * *Default values*: maxNote = 100
Convert the (frequencies, amplitude) list to a (Note, amplitude) list.
