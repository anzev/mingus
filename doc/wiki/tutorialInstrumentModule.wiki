#summary The mingus.containers.Instrument module

----

= Tutorial 4 - Instruments =

We have grouped Notes in !NoteContainers and !NoteContainers in Bars, but before we can add Bars to Tracks, we need an Instrument class.

== Import the Instrument Class and Subclasses ==

{{{

>>> from mingus.containers.Instrument import Instrument, Piano, Guitar

}}}

----

== Working with Instruments ==

The Instrument module is currently very basic (plans on expanding it exist), but it stores all the things the rest of mingus might need. 

{{{

>>> i = Instrument()
>>> i.name
'Instrument'
>>> i.range
('C-0', 'C-8')
>>> i.clef
'bass and treble'

}}}

The easiest way to use the Instrument class is probably to subclass it (see the Piano and Guiter classes), but you can also use the `set_range` function and `name` and `clef` attributes directly.

{{{

>>> i = Instrument()
>>> i.setrange(("C", "E"))
>>> i.name = "Keyboard - five keys"
>>> i.clef = "treble"

}}}

----

== Range Checking ==

Because we have set a range, we can check whether or not a note is within the range of the instrument.

{{{

>>> g = Guitar()
>>> p = Piano()
>>> g.note_in_range("E")
True
>>> g.note_in_range("E-2")
False
>>> p.note_in_range("E-2")
True

}}}

To test multiple notes at once we can either use `notes_in_range` or `can_play_notes`. They both do the same thing and the alias is here for semantic reasons only.

{{{

>>> g = Guitar()
>>> g.can_play_notes(["A", "C", "E"])
True
>>> g.can_play_notes(["A-2", "C-2", "E-2"])
False

}}}

----

== Midi Instruments ==

Another, special subclass of Instrument is the MidiInstrument, which is used throughout the `mingus.midi` module. This instrument has an extra `midi_instr` attribute which you can set to an integer (0..127) to denote the MIDI instrument patch that should be used when playing notes. A list of instrument names is provided as `names` attribute.

{{{

>>> from mingus.containers.Instrument import MidiInstrument
>>> i = MidiInstrument()
>>> i.midi_instr = 14

}}}
